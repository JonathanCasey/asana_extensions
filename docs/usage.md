# Usage

See [setup](setup.md) for required setup prior to first use.


## Executing
Main scripts intended for execution are in the root of `asana_extensions`.
These need to be run from the repo root to make paths work correctly.  E.g.:
```bash
cd /path/to/repo/root
python asana_extensions/main.py
```
