# Asana Extensions

Automation extensions for Asana that I use.  Configurable automations include:
- Move tasks / Auto-promotion rules for user tasks lists, projects.
  - Adds option to include/exclude source sections.
  - Adds support for time ranges and no due date at all.

This is expected to be multi-platform.  It was developed in Windows 10 and is
used in Ubuntu 20.04.

This only supports a single account at this time.  To use with multiple
accounts, clone as many times as needed into different directories, each having
their own personal access tokens and other relevant configurations.
